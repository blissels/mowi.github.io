           <p class="movie-desc1">Harry Potter returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for his third year. The atmosphere is tense as the wizarding world is abuzz with the news of Sirius Black, 
            a dangerous prisoner who has escaped from Azkaban, the most secure wizarding prison. Rumors swirl that Black is after Harry.
            
            As the school year begins, Hogwarts introduces new characters, including Professor Remus Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, and Professor Sybill Trelawney, 
            the eccentric Divination professor. Lupin quickly earns Harry's respect as a skilled and compassionate teacher. <br>
            
            Harry learns more about his parents and their connection to Sirius Black. He discovers that Black was once a close friend of his parents but betrayed them to Lord Voldemort, 
            leading to their tragic demise. The revelation adds a layer of complexity to Harry's emotions as he grapples with the idea of vengeance versus forgiveness.
            
            The students also encounter the infamous Dementors, dark creatures from Azkaban, who guard Hogwarts due to the potential threat of Black. Dementors feed on the darkest memories 
            and emotions of individuals, and their presence at Hogwarts creates a chilling and oppressive atmosphere. Harry, in particular, is deeply affected by them, reliving the trauma 
            of his parents' death whenever they are near. <br>
            
            The story takes a turn when Harry learns that Sirius Black is his godfather and not the villain he was led to believe. Black, wrongly accused of betraying the Potters, is seeking 
            revenge against Peter Pettigrew, the true traitor. The revelation brings a moral dilemma for Harry as he grapples with the desire for justice while questioning the blurred lines 
            between good and evil.</p>
            <p class="movie-desc1">The climax unfolds in the Shrieking Shack, where Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Professor Lupin confront Black and Pettigrew. The truth emerges as Pettigrew 
            is unmasked, and Lupin transforms into a werewolf during a tense confrontation. The scene is both thrilling and emotionally charged as Harry must navigate the complex dynamics of 
            loyalty, betrayal, and forgiveness.
                
            In a surprising twist, Harry spares Pettigrew's life, choosing mercy over vengeance. This act of compassion proves pivotal, as it earns him Black's gratitude and undying loyalty. 
            The film concludes with the trio's return to Hogwarts, the revelation of a time-turner used to save Buckbeak and Sirius Black, and the realization that events are not always as they seem. <br>
                
            "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" stands out as a darker and more mature installment in the series, exploring themes of identity, trust, and the consequences of choices. 
            The film sets the stage for the looming threat of Voldemort's return, hinting at the challenges and adventures awaiting Harry in his future years at Hogwarts.</p>
